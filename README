Roll Over Sphere!

This is(for now) just a simple "game"  where you can move sphere with swipe touch movements(or with mouse moves, while mouse is down on desktop). Try to collect green and yellow cubes and bypass red ones. Small (blue and white) cubes are upgrades. There are 3 modes(arcade - you have N seconds to earn your points, challenge where you must collect all point cubes, a 3rd one is simple freeplay without any boundaries - just for fun!)

Textures are:
one from libgdx package (this one is for sphere)
one from internet(stupid image, I will replace that as soon as I find something better)

For now I know that game works(but it crashes very often :) on samsung galaxy s2 and s and doesnt work on htc wildfire and expreria mini).

Sound on menu screen is just a quick recording of me playing "Chuck Berry wanna be short riff". It has a lot of noise!

If anyone find this game concept interesting I will be glad if you CONTACT me(with a little effort maybe this can be something playable).
If you (in some crasy case) just want to fork for your own game project I will not be that happy, but what the heck, this is free world and source is relased with mit license so do what you want - I DO NOT care
