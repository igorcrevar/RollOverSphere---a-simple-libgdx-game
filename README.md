#### Description
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayilookatgames.rolloverball
Game published on Android market.
Everything is here: code, music, graphics (if someone consider that crap as graphics :D)
Uses excellent libgdx framework.
I'm ok if someone use something from here for his/her own game (well I put MIT license on verything, even music), but I WILL BE MORE
HAPPY if you tell/notify me about that. At least put a comment on google play link or drop me an email or something,

#### How to Build
... import in eclipse and build like any other libgdx project
For Desktop project you may need to fix assets linked source like this:
- delete folder assets in RollOverChuck-desktop project.
- Build Path -> Link source -> Choose assets folder of RollOverChuck-android project

#### Google Play Desc
Slide to move Chuck the ball, pick up cubes and get high score!

Currently there are two modes:
- Arcade
- Stress free

In Arcade mode you have 64 seconds to pick up cubes.

Hard mode also has red cubes which gives you negative points.

There are two "power-ups": one little cube to grow up the ball and one to shrink the ball.
.
Stress free mode is exactly like it sounds: you can play as long as you like.

Google play service Leader-boards are included.

Great rock'n'roll music!
